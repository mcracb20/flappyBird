Creating the game Flappy Bird

This code uses a few loops to create a controllable bird that flies through pipes. These loops include one to create the columns, one to count if the bird went through, and one to check if the bird has hit a pipe. The code also pulls many different classes, including MouseListener, KeyListener, and ActionListener. They were all very funcitonal and very easy to use.
